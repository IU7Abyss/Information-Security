In this laboratory we should link the programm to the computer.

### Before in console (to install gems from Gemfile):

```
bundle install
```

### Usage: 

```
ruby lab1.rb
```

You should change WHITE_ACCESS variable with your generated fingerprint (see Lab1.my_fingerprint) in lab1.rb.
Otherwise you will get "Forbidden. You can't use this program"
